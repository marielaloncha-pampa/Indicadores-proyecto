# Interactive Construction Cost Simulator & Project Dashboard

This repository features a high-impact **Power BI tool** designed as an interactive cost simulator for residential construction. It allows users to dynamically estimate project budgets based on specific home dimensions.

## Key Feature: The Interactive Simulator
Unlike static reports, this tool functions as a **Project Cost Calculator**:
* **Dynamic Input:** Users can select the square footage (m²) of the house.
* **Instant Estimation:** The dashboard automatically calculates total projected costs and resource requirements based on the selected area.
* **"What-If" Analysis:** It helps stakeholders visualize different budget scenarios in real-time before construction begins.

## Performance & Financial Tracking
The dashboard also monitors real-time execution metrics:
* **Incurred vs. Budgeted:** Tracking of actual spending against the simulated or planned budget.
* **Work Progress KPIs:** Visual representation of completion status through Gauge and Pie charts.
* **Variance Analysis:** Identification of financial deviations to ensure project profitability.

## Technical Implementation
* **Advanced DAX:** Complex measures used to power the dynamic simulation and "What-If" parameters.
* **Interactive Data Modeling:** Structured to handle real-time user inputs and recalculate KPIs instantly.
