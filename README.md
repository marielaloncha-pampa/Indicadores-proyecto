# Interactive Residential Cost Simulator & Project Dashboard

This repository showcases a high-impact **Power BI tool** designed as an interactive cost simulator for residential construction. It allows users to estimate project budgets dynamically based on home size and specifications.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The Simulator
Unlike static reports, this dashboard features an **Interactive Cost Calculator**:
* **Dynamic Input:** Users can select the square footage (m²) of their home.
* **Instant Estimation:** The dashboard automatically calculates total costs and resource requirements based on the selected area.
* **Scenario Modeling:** It provides real-time financial projections, helping stakeholders visualize budget needs before starting the project.

## Performance & Financial Tracking
In addition to the simulator, the tool monitors project execution:
* **Incurred vs. Budgeted:** Real-time tracking of actual spending against the simulated budget.
* **Progress KPIs:** Visual representation of work completion status and variance analysis.
* **Resource Allocation:** Detailed breakdown of costs across different project stages.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced DAX:** Complex measures used to power the dynamic simulator logic.
* **User-Centric Design:** Focused on interactivity and "what-if" analysis.
* **Data Modeling:** Efficient structure to handle dynamic calculations.
